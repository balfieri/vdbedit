vdbedit.cpp is a program I use to make various edits (mostly adding grids) to existing OpenVDB (.vdb) files.  The switches control the types of grids that are added.  It also provides a way to create grids from .tif files, stacked or separate.

vdbedit.cpp - program
doit.build  - builds program 
doit.clean  - deletes built files

This is open source.  See LICENSING.md.
