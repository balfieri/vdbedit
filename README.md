vdbedit.cpp is a program that can make various common edits (mostly adding grids) to existing OpenVDB (.vdb) files.  The switches control the types of grids that are added.  It also provides a way to create grids from .tif files, stacked or separate.

You must have OpenVDB, libtbb, libHalf, and libtiff installed on your system.  I have built this only on macOS. doit.build will reqire some changes for other systems.

vdbedit.cpp - program<br>
doit.build  - builds program<br>
doit.clean  - deletes built files<br>

This is open source.  See LICENSING.md.
